# MicroHack: Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse End 2 End

## MicroHack Context

MicroHack is designed to teach you how to integrate, transform, and manage data in a lakehouse using Fabric workloads: Data Factory (data pipelines and data flows), Data Engineering (notebooks with Spark processing), Data Science (AI Functions & Data Agent), and Power BI (semantics layer and reports). You will learn how data engineers, BI analysts, and data scientists leverage lakehouse data to enhance decision-making.

## MicroHack Objectives

- Master Fabric Data Factory, Data Engineering, Data Science, and Power BI.
- Develop a complete data workflow: ingestion, preparation, serving, and operationalization.
- Use Microsoft Fabric to analyze New York City taxi data to improve urban planning and transportation safety.

## Challenges

Focus on implementing **at least the first 6 challenges today** as a minimum out of the 8 major challenges.
