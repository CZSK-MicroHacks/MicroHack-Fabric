## Goal

In this challenge, you will explore data engineering tasks aimed at transforming raw data into a refined [silver layer](/challenges/lakehouse-layers.md). 

By the end of the challenge, you will have completed the second step, the silver layer, of the [medallion architecture](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/medallion-architecture):

## Actions

- Create the 2nd lakehouse: **silvercleansed**
- Import [**challenges/ch04/Transform bronze to silver - Ch04.ipynb**](/challenges/ch04/Transform%20bronze%20to%20silver%20-%20Ch04.ipynb) to you workspace and try to complete all Goals / Actions mentioned in notebook
	- Remove origin lakehouses from Notebook and Add/attach your **bronzerawdata** (as default) lakehouse and **silvercleansed** lakehouse

## Success Criteria

- All success criteria mentioned in the notebook are met
- 6 tables with data in **silvercleansed** lakehouse exist
