## Goal
In this challenge, you will focus on processing unstructured data from real user reviews of locations in New York.

With Microsoft Fabric, all business professionals—data engineers, data scientists, developers, and analysts—can gain more value from their data through Generative AI.

There are two options in Microsoft Fabric today:
1. Use [AI services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-science/ai-services/ai-services-overview) with prebuilt and customizable APIs and models, but you need to develop code to process the output into the final schema:
    - Language Models: gpt-5, gpt-4.1, gpt-4.1-mini, and gpt-4o-mini
    - APIs: Text Analytics, and Azure AI Translator
2. Use the new set of [AI functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-science/ai-functions/overview?tabs=pandas-pyspark%2Cpandas) for data engineering, which is much easier. Fabric users can take advantage of industry-leading large language models (LLMs) to transform and enrich data with just a single line of code.

By the end of this challenge, you will have a new dataset with sentiment, classification, summarization, translation, key topics, and location extracted from real user reviews.

> [!TIP]
It’s up to you which option you choose, but this challenge is designed for **AI functions**.


## Actions

- You can create new lakehohouse for Sandboxing or use **goldcurated**
