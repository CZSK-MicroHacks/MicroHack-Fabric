# Ch02: Ingest *raw* data with data pipelines and shortcuts

## Goal
Focus on integrating two data sources from NYC taxi data: one from 2015 and the other from 2023. The table below presents the metaphors we will use to integrate the data:

**Tasks Overview:**
* Data Ingestion: Initiate by loading historical data assets from the year 2015, a period when Azure Blob Storage was the zenith of data storage solutions. This step will simulate the transition of legacy data into a modern data ecosystem.
* Data Integration and Analysis: Shift focus to more recent data, specifically from January 2023. During this time, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2 (ADLS Gen2) became the benchmark for data storage in Azure. Instead of traditional data copying methods, you will leverage the innovative `Shortcuts` feature to streamline the integration process within our Lakehouse architecture.

By the end of the challenge, you will have completed the first step, the bronze layer, of the [medallion architecture](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/medallion-architecture):

### Actions

- Create Pipeline: Ingest Green Taxi 2015
	- With Copy Activity to Ingest Data:
		- Source: Azure Blob Storage: https://stfabricmicrohacksw.blob.core.windows.net/ 
			- Authentication kind Shared Access Signature (SAS): sv=2024-11-04&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rlfx&se=2025-11-30T00:36:28Z&st=2025-10-06T15:21:28Z&spr=https&sig=AukZMGIOO%2BdjC%2BAbRmaNpGsg8jagziY0WimASjtiTZw%3D
			- File path: 
				- Container: **taxidata**
				- File: **green_tripdata_2015-01.parquet**
			- File format: **Binary**
		- Destination : Lakehouse **bronzerawdata**
			- File path directory: **Landing/GreenTaxi2015**
			- Format: **Binary**
    
- Create Shortcut in your Lakehouse into **Files > Landing** to **2023** Folder in Azure Data Lake Gen2: 
	- https://adlstfabricmicrohacksw.dfs.core.windows.net/ 
		- Authentication kind Shared Access Signature (SAS): sv=2024-11-04&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2025-11-30T00:38:39Z&st=2025-10-06T15:23:39Z&spr=https&sig=HCus0m0ysS3EU4MlOrcmdmc5KNYNNHxhUS1WvkR1hRc%3D

## Success Criteria

- You have File "**green_tripdata_2015-01.parquet**" in your Lakehouse: Files > Landing > GreenTaxi2015
	- You can see the content of the file
- You have shortcut to Folder "2023" in your Lakehouse with files "**NYC-Taxi-Discounts-Per-Day.csv**" and "**green_tripdata_2023-01.parquet**"
	- You can see the content of both files
