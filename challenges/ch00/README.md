# Ch00: New Azure User Setup


## Obtain your user credential from the organizers of this event.

During the very start of this event, you will receive the credentials for new Azure / Fabric user. This user is new even for the working tenant and needs to be onboarded by you. This process is quite easy and includes multiple steps. 

During the process you will need some private *authenticator* app such as **Microsoft Authenticator** or **Google Authenticator**

You will receive the credentials in the following format:

> **Credentials**
> 
> | Login | Password |
> |-------|----------|
> | `UserXX@fabric.microhack.org` | `dummyHeslo1234` |

## Actions

1) Open the website https://portal.azure.com and if you are logged in with your account, *Sign out* first. Alternatively, open the website in a Private browser window.

2) Log in with your user and password.

3) In this step, you will be prompted to add your own authenticator and enable multi-factor authentication.

In your Authenticator app, don't forge to choose the "Work or School" account as instructed. After you scan the code, click NEXT.

On the next screen, you will be prompted with the number - authenticate on your phone authenticator app with that number.

The resulting screen should look like the following - finish the wizard.
